# 8bitworkshop for VS Code

![8bitworkshop running a program in VS Code](https://8bitworkshop.com/images/vscode_demo.gif)

The original online 8-bit IDE, now in VS Code!

Features:
- Built-in emulators, compilers, and libraries from [8bitworkshop.com](https://8bitworkshop.com)
- See your code changes in the emulator immediately
- Single-step debugging with breakpoints, disassembly, call stack, symbols
- Sample code for each platform
- Syntax highlighting for 8-bit assembly language and Verilog (`.v` files in Verilog projects, including inline `__asm` blocks)

Platforms include 6502, Z80, and 6809 CPUs:

- **Atari 2600 (VCS)**, **Atari 7800**, and **Atari 8-bit** computers
- **Commodore 64** and **VIC-20**
- **NES / Famicom** and **Game Boy**
- **ColecoVision**, **MSX**, **Sega Master System**
- **ZX Spectrum**, **Amstrad CPC**, **Apple II**, , **PC Engine**
- **Arcade hardware**

Programming languages include:

- **Assembler** with DASM, ca65, zmac, and more
- **C** with CC65, SDCC, and more
- **BASIC** with batariBASIC and FastBASIC
- **Verilog** for hardware design and simulation
- ...and more! There's a lot going on in here!

All building and emulation runs on your computer.
The toolchains and examples are included in the extension.

## Get started

1. Open an empty window. The Explorer sidebar shows a **New 8bitworkshop
   Project** button below **Open Folder**; click it. Or run
   **8bitworkshop: New Project...** from the Command Palette.
2. Choose a platform, such as **NES** or **Atari 2600 (VCS)**.
3. Choose **8bitworkshop: Open Example** from the Command Palette.
4. Click **Run** (▷) or **Debug** at the top right of the editor. The emulator opens
   beside your code.
5. Click on the emulator window to play.

Change something and the game rebuilds and restarts as you type. Errors
appear as red underlines and in the **Problems** panel, and the last
version that built keeps running until you fix them.

To use code you already have, open its folder: the extension detects the appropriate platform and main file.

You don't need Microsoft's C/C++ extension: this extension builds your C code
and reports its errors. VS Code suggests C/C++ whenever you open a `.c` file,
so new projects include a `.vscode/extensions.json` that turns the suggestion
off for that folder.

## Settings

Project settings, saved in `.vscode/settings.json`:

| Setting | What it does |
|---|---|
| `8bitworkshop.platform` | The platform, such as `nes`, `c64`, or `vcs` |
| `8bitworkshop.mainFile` | The file that runs. Empty: the file in the editor |
| `8bitworkshop.tool` | The build tool, when it isn't the usual one for the file |
| `8bitworkshop.folders` | Projects in subfolders |
| `8bitworkshop.exportRomPath` | Folder for exported ROMs, relative to the main file (`bin` by default) |

Your local user settings:

| Setting | What it does |
|---|---|
| `8bitworkshop.autoBuild` | `onType` (default), `onSave`, or `off` |
| `8bitworkshop.reloadOnBuild` | `always` (default), `onSave`, or `never` |
| `8bitworkshop.exportRom` | Write each successful build's ROM to the export folder |
| `8bitworkshop.terminalCommand` | Add the `8bws` command to the integrated terminal (off by default) |

## Commands

Every command is under **8bitworkshop:** in the Command Palette; several
also appear in the editor title bar, the Explorer, or **Project Options**.

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| **New Project...** | Create a project from an example or a blank program |
| **Open Example** | Open a bundled example without copying it |
| **Copy to Workspace** | Copy the open example into your workspace |
| **Set as Main File** | Make the active file the one that runs |
| **Change Main File...** | Pick the main file from the workspace |
| **Change Platform...** | Build the project for another platform |
| **Detect Projects** | Scan the folder for projects and platforms |
| **Add Launch Configuration** | Write a run configuration to `.vscode/launch.json`; <kbd>F5</kbd> debugs it, with step back |
| **Project Options** | Open the project menu |
| **Build** | Build without running |
| **Run** | Build and run in the emulator |
| **Debug** | Build and debug in the emulator, with breakpoints and step back |
| **Run This File** | Run the active file, without changing the project |
| **Run Main File** | Run the project's main file |
| **Follow Active Editor** | Run whichever program is in the editor |
| **Reset / Pause / Resume / Stop / Mute / Unmute Emulator** | Control the emulator panel (shown while it is open) |

## Books

Many of the examples come from the 8bitworkshop books. The New Project
and Open Example lists show which platforms have one.

## Error reports

When a compiler or the emulator crashes, the extension sends an error report
to 8bitworkshop.com: the error message, stack trace, platform, and tool, plus
VS Code and extension versions. It doesn't send your source files, and VS Code
removes file paths from the report before it leaves. Errors in your program,
like a syntax error or a crash in the emulated machine, aren't reported.

VS Code attaches identifiers to every report: a machine id (stable for your
VS Code install, not tied to your identity), a session id, and a device id.
These group reports from one install together.

The reports follow VS Code's `telemetry.telemetryLevel` setting: set it to
`off` to stop them.

## Agents

AI agents can build and test your program too. Agents that use VS Code's
tools, such as Copilot's agent mode, get **Build 8bitworkshop Program** and
**Run 8bitworkshop Program**, which returns a screenshot. Agents in the
terminal, such as Claude Code, use the `8bws` command, once you turn on
`8bitworkshop.terminalCommand`. See
[AI agents and the terminal](https://github.com/sehugg/8bitworkshop/blob/master/extension/docs/building.md#ai-agents).

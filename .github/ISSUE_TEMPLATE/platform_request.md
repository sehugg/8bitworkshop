# Feature Request

## What is the platform do you want to be added to the IDE?
Please put the platform you want to be added to the IDE here

## Is the platform programmable with a high level language?
Is the platform you want to suggest programmable with a high level programming language (Like C or BASIC)? If you don't know if the platform can be programmable with a high level programming language, you can delete or ignore this selection. Otherwise put a high level programming language that the platform can be programmed with. (Assembly is not a high level programming language but instead low level)

# Disassembly

The Disassembly window disassembles machine code around the current
program counter. It is available on platforms that expose both a
disassembler and a savable CPU state.

Each line shows:

| Column | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| Address | The 16-bit program counter for the instruction |
| Bytes | The raw opcode bytes (padded for alignment) |
| Mnemonic | The disassembled instruction |
| Comment | The symbol defined at that address, if any |

The view is centered on the program counter (PC). While debugging, it
follows the PC as you step. Symbol names are substituted for addresses
when a symbol map is available, so jumps and loads show labels instead
of raw hex.

## Navigating

- **Go To Address** re-centers the window on an address or symbol and
  highlights it.
- Addresses in the operand columns are linked to their symbols when the
  map contains them.

## Listing vs. disassembly

The Disassembly window is generated live by the emulator's disassembler.
A compiler or assembler *listing* is a separate, read-only window built
from the tool's own output; see [Editor](editor.md). The listing follows
the program counter using the line-to-address map from the assembler,
which is more accurate for source-level navigation than the live
disassembly.

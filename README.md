## Tool Server (experimental)

This is an experimental feature that relies on a Docker container to provide compiler tools like [llvm-mos](https://github.com/llvm-mos/llvm-mos-sdk).
Right now, you have to run locally and build your own docker container.

```sh
docker build -t 8bitws-server-debian scripts/docker
docker run -p 3009:3009 8bitws-server-debian
echo '{"REMOTE_URL":"http://localhost:3009/build"}' > remote.json
```

Then add "&tool=llvm-mos" to your URL, like
[this](http://localhost:8000/?platform=c64&file=sprite_collision.c&tool=llvm-mos).
You can also rename your C files to have the suffix "-llvm.c".
Right now only the platforms c64, atari8, nes (NROM), and pce are supported.
Not very many of the current examples work with the new toolchain.
